### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on AI/ML models, devops configurations, and dockerizing, ahem, containerizing the world!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning:
  -  golang/rust
  -  More maintainable Python architectures
  -  Embedded C/C++
  -  How to start my own software business
  -  You can find my other work at [Nostos Labs](https://gitlab.com/nostoslabs)

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any open source AI/ML software where I could be of use.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with making free speech a thing again.
- 💬 Ask me about Weston Price Foundation.
- 📫 How to reach me: markus@kreitzer.dev
- ⚡ Fun fact: Namibia has some of the highest sand dunes in the world (I'm not from there but I really want to go.)
